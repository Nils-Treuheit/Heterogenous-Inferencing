# Heterogenous-Inferencing
Project is Part of the "Hardware Accelerators for AI - Hands On" Course at the Otto-von-Guericke University

We try to implement an efficient way to evaluate heterogenous inferencing infrastructures for convolutional neural networks. Our heterogenous inferencing infrastructure will consist of an IntelÂ® Neural Compute Stick 2, an USB Accelerator based on the Edge TPU from Coral and Intel CPU and integrated Graphics Card.
