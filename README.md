# Heterogenous-Inferencing
Project is Part of the ["Hardware Accelerators for AI - Hands On"](https://elearning.ovgu.de/course/view.php?id=11672) Course at the [Otto-von-Guericke University](https://www.ovgu.de/en/)

We try to implement an efficient way to evaluate heterogenous inferencing infrastructures for convolutional neural networks. Our heterogenous inferencing infrastructure will consist of an [IntelÂ® Neural Compute Stick 2](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/de/de/ark/products/140109/intel-neural-compute-stick-2.html), an [USB Accelerator based on the Edge TPU from Coral](https://coral.ai/products/accelerator/) and Intel CPU and integrated Graphics Card.
